  <h4>If you don't know what a Critical Mass is, please refer to the <a>tutorial</a>.</h4>

  <p>
    Knowing how many people have been at your CriticalMass is a memory, cool for the stats nerds and also helps you to decide where to go. Also you are able to see live statistics about your current mass.
  </p>
  <p>
    This App aims to automate everything but counting. Every time you start the counter, it checks your location and saves the number of bikes you counted into a database.
  </p>
  <p>
    That allows you to see where and when you counted how many bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the future I might collaborate with Malte from criticalmass.in and give him access to the data.

  <h3>
    Q: What kind of data do you store?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A: I want to store only the data neccessary for the service. So here is what is stored:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A bike was counted (acutally: Someone clicked on the app)
    </li>
    <li>
      Date, time and location of that event
    </li>
    <li>
      What phone counted the bike. Actually I generate one anonymous identifier which is used to not get your count confused with others. I don't know who you are, what device you use, or what you look like. And I really don't care. :)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Q: I can't find any statistics?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A: Yes, this is very much work in progress. Head right to the next question, if you want to help out.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Q: Cool project, can I participate?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A: Of course! Just head right over to <a href="https://github.com/zeidlos/CriticalCounter">Github</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Q: I have a project and want to use your data! How?
    </h3>
    <p>
      A: Right now I have not implemented an API for you to use. But if you can code, you could help, since I'd love to share. :)
    </p>
  <h3>
    Q: I can't code, but want to say thank you!
  </h3>
  <p>
    A: No problem! If you are in Hamburg, you can buy me a coffee on the next Mass. If you're not from Hamburg, go and buy someone else a coffee. Spread the love!
